# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another â€“ transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

blockchain = [
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "brian", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 9000 },
  { "from_user" => "brian", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 7000 },
  { "from_user" => "evan", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 400 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 1500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 4500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 1750 }
]

# 1. create 4 variables to represent each user's balance

bens_balance = 0
brians_balance = 0
evans_balance = 0
anthonys_balance = 0

# 2. loop through the "blockchain" transactions

for transaction in blockchain
  # each "transaction" in the "blockchain" array is a Hash
  #puts transaction
  # 3. if the user is the "from_user", decrement their balance
  
  if transaction["from_user"] == "ben"
    bens_balance = bens_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "brian"
    brians_balance = brians_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "evan"
    evans_balance = evans_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "anthony"
    anthonys_balance = anthonys_balance - transaction["amount"]
  end

  # 4. if the user is the "to_user", increment their balance

  if transaction["to_user"] == "ben"
    bens_balance = bens_balance + transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["to_user"] == "brian"
    brians_balance = brians_balance + transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["to_user"] == "evan"
    evans_balance = evans_balance + transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["to_user"] == "anthony"
    anthonys_balance = anthonys_balance + transaction["amount"]
  end
end

# 5. finally, print out the result

puts "Ben's KelloggCoin balance is #{bens_balance}"
puts "Brian's KelloggCoin balance is #{brians_balance}"
puts "Evan's KelloggCoin balance is #{evans_balance}"
puts "Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is #{anthonys_balance}"

#THE CHALLENGE
# The above solution gets the job done and there's no need to go any further.  However, if this solution is leaving you a bit dissatisfied, then you're starting to think like a programmer!  

# Why might you be feeling dissatisfied - i.e. what are the drawbacks?

# Well, this solution only works with these 4 specific users.  But what if we added someone new to the blockchain?  We would need to duplicate a lot of the code to accommodate other user balances.  Are there other ways to implement the solution that are not dependent on knowing who and how many users there are in the transactions?

# See if you can challenge yourself!

#users = ["ben","brian"]
puts "Starting the dynamic process"
users =[]

for transaction in blockchain
  #New User Logic Below
  new_user_check = false
  puts "my user count is #{users.size}"
  for existing_user in users
    if transaction["to_user"] !=  existing_user["name"] #|| transaction["from_user"] !=  existing_user["name"] 
      new_user_check = true
      #users.push({"name" => transaction["to_user"], "wallet" => 0})  #no need for hash infront variable within transaction
    end
  end
  if new_user_check == true || users.size == 0
    users.push({"name" => transaction["to_user"], "wallet" => 0})  #no need for hash infront variable within transaction
  end 

    #balance logic below 
  for user in users
    if transaction["from_user"] == user["name"]  # Must reference the "current user" not the array "users"
      user["wallet"] = user["wallet"] - transaction["amount"]
    end
    if transaction["to_user"] == user["name"]  # Must reference the "current user" not the array "users"
      user["wallet"] = user["wallet"] + transaction["amount"]
    end
  end
end
#puts users Update input statement to format outputs to match request on assignment. 
puts users
